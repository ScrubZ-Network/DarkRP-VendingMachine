DarkRP Vending Machine v3.2
=======

DarkRP Vending Machine for Garry's Mod 13 DarkRP 2.7+

The Vending Machine is just as it sounds. It's a functioning vending machine that gives you soda in exchange for DarkRP money. There is a full configuration to control what the vending machine gives you from health, energy, armor and more.

Update: This is my first time updating this machine in probably 8-9 years. There will be bugs.

What's new?
-------
- Cleaned up configuration a bit and removed old spawn config.
- Added JSON format saving for the Vending Machines.
- Added configuration to enable/disable sounds.
- Pulled commit that fixed Cooks on duty config.
